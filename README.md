# Phase-Partitioned-Kernels
Cloud radiative kernels for partitioning cloud feedbacks by cloud-top phase in GCM output

This file contains a shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) cloud radiative kernels that can be used with joint histograms from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite simulator in output from global climate model (GCM) simulations. The kernel and histograms are partitioned by cloud-top pressure (CTP) and cloud visible optical thickness (COT). Separate kernels are provided for liquid-topped clouds, ice-topped clouds, and "undetermined"-phase clouds. The cloud-top phase is classified according to the visible extinction between the top of the highest cloud and one optical depth unit below. If the visible extinction in this interval is 70% or more from liquid droplets, then the cloud is classified as liquid. If the visible extinction in this interval is 70% or more from ice crystals, then the cloud is classified as ice. If neither of these conditions are satisfied, then the cloud is classified as "undetermined" phase for consistency with MODIS observational data. The kernels have dimensions of clear-sky surface albedo, latitude, CTP, COT, and calendar month. They can be transformed from surface-albedo-latitude space to longitude-latitude space with linear interpolation.
